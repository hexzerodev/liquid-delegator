# Agora Liquid Delegator

## Goal

Agora Liquid Delegator (codename Alligator) allows token holders to subdelegate all their votes to multiple people according to a set of rules. Any delegatee can further sub-delegate their votes to others, optionally adding even more rules.

For example, a token holder `0xAAA` delegates their votes to `0xBBB`, but only allows `0xBBB` use the tokens on proposals that move less than 100 ETH from the treasury. `0xBBB` sub-delegates their votes to `0xCCC`, but only allows voting in the last 12 hours before the vote closes. `0xCCC` can now use `0xAAA`'s voting power to cast a vote, but only on small proposals and only in the last 12 hours.

## Features

1. Sub-delegate to as any number of subjects
2. Add rules to sub-delegation:
   - Permissions: create proposal, vote, sign (via EIP-1271)
   - Limit number of re-delegations
   - Set timestamp range when sub-delegation is active
   - Limit voting to a number of blocks before vote closes
   - Custom rules (calls external contract to validate)
3. Casting votes, creating new proposals and voting on Prop House
4. Batched operations
5. Gas refund

### WORK IN PROGRESS

There's a few TODO items in the code and the tests are not comprehensive. But the repo is in good enough shape to ask for external feedback on the architecture & approach.

## How it works

Alligator is designed to work without holding user's tokens.

1. Alligator deploys a proxy contract for every token holder who wants to use the system. The proxy's address is deterministic and the proxy can be deployed by anyone. The proxy only allows commands from Alligator itself.
2. The user who wants to delegate their voting power via Alligator's system must first delegate (not transfer!) the original tokens (ERC20s or ERC721s) to the corresponding Alligator's proxy.
3. The user can now configure sub-delegations. They can sub-delegate to any number of other users and can limit the sub-delegation to a set of specific rules.
4. The user who is delegated to can now vote by calling the corresponding function on Alligator. The user must include one or more delegation chains that they want to exercise.
5. The rules engine checks if the subdelegations are allowed, and forwards the request to vote to a proxy. The proxy casts a vote on Governor contract.

### Authority chains

When a user votes via Alligator, they need to construct an authority chain off-chain and send it with their request (similar to Uniswap routing). This way Alligator can only store the essential information and pushes the complexity of finding the most beneficial chain.

The authority chain can be constructed by listening to on-chain subdelegation events and reconstructing graphs. It's possible there will be a few authority chains available to the same user with different constraints.

```
 SubDelegations:                       Authority Chains:
┌────────┬────────┬───────────────┐
│  FROM  │   TO   │     RULES     │    ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
├────────┼────────┼───────────────┤    │ 0xAAA │──▶│ 0xBBB │──▶│ 0xCCC │
│ 0xAAA  │ 0xBBB  │   < 100 ETH   │    └───────┘   └───────┘   └───────┘
├────────┼────────┼───────────────┤
│ 0xBBB  │ 0xCCC  │   Last 12h    │    ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
├────────┼────────┼───────────────┤    │ 0xFFF │──▶│ 0xCCC │
│ 0xFFF  │ 0xCCC  │Expires on 2023│    └───────┘   └───────┘
└────────┴────────┴───────────────┘
```

In the example above, the user `0xCCC` can use `0xAAA`'s and `0xFFF`'s voting power by calling:

```
Alligator.castVotesWithReasonBatched([[0xAAA, 0xBBB, 0xCCC], [0xFFF, 0xCCC]], 1, 1, "");
```

From the Governor's perspective, it looks like users `0xAAA's proxy` and `0xFFF's proxy` are casting their votes.

```
╔══════════╗              ┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
║User 0xAAA║─ delegated ─▶│  0xAAA's proxy   │──vote──▶│                  │
╚══════════╝              └──────────────────┘         │     Governor     │
╔══════════╗              ┌──────────────────┐         │                  │
║User 0xFFF║─ delegated ─▶│  0xFFF's proxy   │──vote──▶│                  │
╚══════════╝              └──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘
```

### Other design considerations

1. Should the rules be scoped to proxy or delegator? The initial prototype of Alligator used per-proxy rules, but we don't think in real life users want different sets of rules for different lots, and it's not how the original Governor works. E.g. if `0xAAA` subdelegates to `0xBBB`, we assume A trusts B (within the set rules) so if `0xCCC` delegates to `0xAAA`, `0xBBB` should be able to use these votes. It's also less on-chain storage and better scaling.

2. Should we support exclusive delegation? I.e. if `0xAAA` delegates to `0xBBB`, should `0xAAA` still be able to use that voting power? Supporting this would increase the complexity and raise many questions (e.g. if `0xCCC` delegates to `0xAAA`, can `0xAAA` still vote?). It could also easily be tricked by `0xAAA` via un-delegating, voting, and re-delegating back to `0xBBB`. So unless we introduce snapshots, adding exclusive delegation support doesn't give us much.

3. Is it possible to subdelegate a fraction of the tokens? According to our research, it's not possible unless we either hold users' tokens or change how the base token voting snapshots work. Alligator could theoretically used with something like [Franchiser](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser) (but we haven't tested this).

4. We are trying to make the contract as ergonomic as possible for the end users. Any friction will result in less actions taken, and we want more government participation. So ideally it should take the minimum number of transactions to set things up and use. For the setup, we need proxy deployment, delegate the original tokens and configure the rules. The proxy deployment is permissionless and can be done beforehand for big users. We can't get around the original token delegation transaction. Configuring the rules should be batched too. For voting, we want to have batched versions of castVote, offering a user to use different chains of authority to vote on a single proposal. We also offer a refund, if funds for it are available.

5. To limit EIP-1271 signatures to Prop House only, we are planning to do EIP-712 hashing on the contract side and check if the domain corresponds to the Prop House.

6. Should the base implementation of Alligator be upgradeable? Not sure, it adds marginal gas cost and security considerations. If we work on extending the feature set of Alligator, we can ask the users who want the extra features to re-delegate to Alligator v2, v3, etc.

## Running tests:

1. Install [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
2. `forge test`

## Deploying to testnet:

1. Fund `0x77777101E31b4F3ECafF209704E947855eFbd014` with SepoliaETH
2. Get Etherscan API key
3. `forge script script/DeployAlligator.s.sol -vvvv --fork-url https://rpc-sepolia.rockx.com --chain-id 11155111 --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`

## Attack surface

Alligator does not hold user's tokens, so it's not possible to steal the tokens using a potential bug in the contract. However, it controls voting power which can be abused to vote on malicious proposals (e.g. transfer all the treasury tokens to evil.eth).
